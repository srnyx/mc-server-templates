# default config.yml for ConsoleSpamFix
# config version 1.9.0

#Add here the messages you want to hide from your console and logs.
#Each line represents a new message.
#NOTE! You dont need to add the full message!
#The plugin will hide all messages that contain the text added below.
#  EXAMPLE:
#
#    Messages-To-Hide-Filter:
#    - "WARNING: unlocalizedName"
#
#  All messages that will appear in the server console that contain these words "WARNING: unlocalizedName" will be hidden and they will not appear on logs or console.
#  If you have large errors you dont have to type the full error. But the more words you add the more accurate will be and will not hide other messages that may contain the words added in the filter.

Messages-To-Hide-Filter:
- "has registered a listener for org.bukkit.event.entity.EntityCreatePortalEvent on method \"public void com.onarandombox.MultiverseCore.listeners.MVPortalListener.entityPortalCreate(org.bukkit.event.entity.EntityCreatePortalEvent)\", but the event is Deprecated. \"Server performance will be affected\"; please notify the authors"
- "We are aware of the warning about the deprecated event. There is no alternative that allows us to do what we need to do and performance impact is negligible. It is safe to ignore."
- "which is not a depend or softdepend of this plugin."
- "This plugin is not compatible with the version of Minecraft you are using."
- "- Enable the stopper to remove all future Pillager spawners (Last resort)"
- "Initializing Legacy Material Support. Unless you have legacy plugins and/or data this is a bug!"
- "does not specify an api-version."
- "Neither the DataFixer nor defaulting worked to recognize this item."
