enabled: true

# How should we determine whether the view distance needs adjusting? Accepts three values:
#  * proactive : Adjust the view distance so that the player-loaded chunk count is always below a set threshold.
#  * reactive  : Adjust the view distance in response to changes in the server's TPS.
#  * mixed     : Be both proactive and reactive; prioritising decreasing the view distance over increasing.
adjustment-mode: mixed

# These settings are for the proactive adjustment mode.
proactive-mode-settings:
  # Set this to the maximum chunk count your server can handle. The view distance of each world will be adjusted such
  # that the total number of player-loaded chunks is sitting as close to this value as possible.
  #  * If you know your server can handle up to p many players with a view distance of d, a reasonable choice is to set
  #    this to (2d + 1)^2 * p.
  #  * As an example, 5780 is the number of player-loaded chunks for 20 players with a view distance of 8.
  global-chunk-count-target: 5780

# These settings are for the reactive adjustment mode.
reactive-mode-settings:
  # Above what TPS should we consider increasing the view distance?
  increase-tps-threshold: 19.9

  # Below what TPS should we consider decreasing the view distance?
  decrease-tps-threshold: 18.0

  # These settings concern how we determine the TPS.
  #  * Only touch these settings if you know what you're doing.
  tps-tracker-settings:
    # Over how many ticks should we collect tick durations for calculating the TPS?
    #  * Setting this too high will make the TPS very slow to react to changes.
    #  * Setting this too low will make the TPS volatile.
    collection-period: 1200

    # By how much (in percent) should we allow the tick durations we use to calculate the TPS vary from the average
    # tick duration.
    #  * This is used for smoothing the TPS; making sure it's not heavily affected by sudden large lag spikes, such as
    #    those caused by garbage collections or world-saves.
    #  * Setting this to 0 will mean your TPS will never change - don't do that.
    trim-outliers-to-within: 100.0

  # We keep a history of TPS vs. player-loaded chunk count in order to better predict what the TPS will settle to after
  # increasing the view distance.
  tps-prediction:
    # Should we use TPS prediction when we are considering increasing the view distance?
    #  * For example, we may be at 20 TPS with a view distance of 6, meaning we would consider increasing the view
    #    distance to 7. However, if we saw that 10 minutes ago with a view distance of 7 we had 17 TPS, we would hold
    #    off on increasing.
    #  * Disabling this can lead to a back-and-forth game of increasing and decreasing the view distance every few
    #    minutes - not ideal.
    enabled: true

    # For how long (in minutes) should we keep a TPS / chunk count history?
    history-length: 30

# Every how many ticks should we check whether the view distance needs to be updated?
ticks-per-check: 600

# How long in ticks should we wait before starting the checking tasks following the plugin's start up?
#  * This is useful when using the 'mixed' or 'reactive' adjustment modes where it is desirable to ignore the server's
#    performance in the first few minutes following a restart.
start-up-delay: 2400

# How many checks in a row that say to increase the view distance should be required before the view distance is
# actually increased?
#  * This is useful as it guards against the following kind of case: A player leaves and the view distance is increased,
#    but the player returns three minutes later and the view distance is lowered to its previous value.
#  * Since increasing the view distance can cause lag-spikes for players with poorer connections, it is recommended to
#    keep this value relatively high.
passed-checks-for-increase: 10

# How many checks in a row that say to decrease the view distance should be required before the view distance is
# actually decreased?
passed-checks-for-decrease: 1

# Should we send a message to the console when we change the view distance?
log-view-distance-changes: false

# These settings can be specified per world. If a world is not specified or if a setting is missing, it will use the
# settings listed under the default section.
world-settings:
  default:
    # Should we not manage the view distance in this world?
    #  * Note: Even if excluded, the world's chunks will be counted for the purpose of adjusting the view distance of
    #    other worlds. If you do not want this, also be sure to set the chunk-weight to 0.
    exclude: false

    # What should the absolute minimum view distance be in this world?
    minimum-view-distance: 6

    # What should the absolute maximum view distance be in this world?
    maximum-view-distance: 12

    # Relative to the other worlds, how 'heavy' is a chunk on performance?
    #  * For example: In the End dimension, about half of the chunks you encounter are void and so have very little
    #    impact on performance. For this reason, you may want to set the chunk-weight of the End to 0.5.
    chunk-weight: 1

    # These settings concern how we count the number of chunks in this world.
    chunk-counter-settings:
      # When two players are near each other, their view distances can overlap. Should we not double count the chunks
      # that are overlapping?
      exclude-overlap: true

#  world_the_end:
#    minimum-view-distance: 8
#    maximum-view-distance: 10
#    chunk-weight: 0.5

# These are additional settings that apply if you are using Paper as your server software.
paper-settings:
  # These settings concern the no-tick view distance available in Paper 1.15.2+.
  #  * Note: higher no-tick view distances are less heavy on the server as far as TPS goes. For this reason, there is no
  #    option to adjust no-tick view distance based on TPS.
  no-tick-view-distance:
    # Should we adjust the no-tick view distance?
    enabled: true

    # Set this to the maximum number of chunks you want to be loaded by the no-tick view distance.
    #  * Note: this only counts chunks that are outside of the standard view distance of a player, but within the
    #    no-tick view distance of a player.
    #  * If you know your server can handle up to p many players with a no-tick view distance of n and a standard view
    #    distance of d, a reasonable choice is to set this to ((2n + 1)^2 - (2d + 1)^2) * p.
    #  * As an example, 6720 is the number of chunks loaded by the no-tick view distance for 20 players with a no-tick
    #    view distance of 12, and a standard view distance of 8.
    global-chunk-count-target: 6720

  # These settings are an alternative option to the reactive-mode-settings, allowing view distance to be adjusted based
  # on MSPT rather than TPS.
  #  * MSPT stands for "milliseconds per tick", and tells you how long your server takes to tick on average. A server
  #    whose MSPT is above 50 will notice things slowing down, as the TPS drops.
  alternative-reactive-mode-settings:
    # Should we use these alternative settings for reactive mode?
    use-alternative-settings: false

    # Below what MSPT should we considering increasing the view distance?
    increase-mspt-threshold: 40.0

    # Above what MSPT should we consider decreasing the view distance?
    decrease-mspt-threshold: 47.0

    # These settings concern how we determine the server's MSPT.
    #  * Only touch these settings if you know what you're doing.
    mspt-tracker-settings:
      # Over how many ticks should we collect tick durations for calculating the MSPT?
      #  * Setting this too high will make the MSPT very slow to react to changes.
